# Capstone Project

How to make keras and tensorflow work on AMD GPU:
python-keras python-tensorflow tensorflow tensorflow-opt python-tensorflow-opt
in Arch repositories. Don't know yet the commands to make it work on other OSes.

Supply your own Google App password by defining it in main.py

## TODO:
- Fix image sizes. It's all way too wonky. Or figure out a way to do the whole
  thing with conflicting image sizes.
- Optimize tensorflow. Maybe make emotion recognition run every 5 seconds?
