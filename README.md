# Capstone Project

To get tensorflow, keras, and thus fer to work on a non-Nvidia machine, you need
to install python-keras python-tensorflow tensorflow tensorflow-opt
python-tensorflow-opt from the Arch Linux package repositories. I don't know how
to do the same for any other OS.

Download the data files folder and extract it to the base directory of this
repository. ZIP archive of the folder can be found here:

## TODO:
- Fix image sizes. It's all way too wonky. Or figure out a way to do the whole
  thing with conflicting image sizes.
- Optimize tensorflow. Maybe make emotion recognition run every 5 seconds?
- Compile all the modules into a working version of the project. Remove
  unnecessary operations (like displaying the picture on screen).
