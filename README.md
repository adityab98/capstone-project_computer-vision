# Capstone Project

## TODO:
- Work with live video feeds (DONE)
    - Detect faces in live video feeds (DONE)
    - Recognize faces in live video feeds (DONE)
    - Move live video feeds to its own function (DONE)
- Face recognition training with multiple faces in one image? (Probably
  unnecessary)
- Fix image sizes. It's all way too wonky. Or figure out a way to do the whole
  thing with conflicting image sizes.
